% Problematic Section
\section{Problematic Overview}
\textbf{\textcolor{navy}{Ocean pollution}} is one of the most significant challenges of our time. With \textbf{8â€“10 million tons of plastic} entering the ocean each year, the consequences for marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and even the global economy are catastrophic. From marine animals choking on plastic to economic losses in fisheries and tourism, the ripple effects are undeniable.

This document will analyze:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The amount of debris in the ocean.
    \item How pollution affects marine life and biodiversity.
    \item The economic consequences.
    \item Types of pollution present in oceans.
    \item Barriers pollution creates for ocean exploration.
\end{itemize}

% Section 1: Amount of Debris in Oceans
\subsection{Amount of Debris in Oceans}
The oceans are inundated with waste, primarily plastic. Research from \textbf{NOAA} and \textbf{UNEP} shows that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{8 million metric tons of plastic waste} are dumped annually.
    \item By \textbf{2050}, there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean (by weight).
\end{itemize}

% Section 2: Effects on Marine Life
\subsection{Effects on Marine Life}
Marine animals are particularly vulnerable to plastic pollution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entanglement: Animals get caught in fishing nets and plastic debris, leading to injuries or death.
    \item Ingestion: Mistaking plastic for food, animals suffer blockages, malnutrition, and poisoning.
\end{itemize}

% Section 4: Economic Impact
\subsection{Economic Impact}

Ocean pollution costs the global economy billions annually. Major areas affected include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fisheries: Plastic pollution reduces fish stocks, leading to losses for fisheries.
    \item Tourism: Polluted beaches and waters deter tourists, impacting coastal economies.
    \item Healthcare: Increased costs due to health problems linked to marine pollution.
\end{itemize}


% Section 5: Barriers to Exploration
\subsection{Barriers to Exploration}

Ocean pollution hampers marine exploration. Specialists cannot access key areas due to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pollution Hazards: Risks to equipment and divers.
    \item Reduced Visibility: Pollution clouds water, limiting exploration.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]

In this section, we describe how we divided tasks and organized them using a Google Sheet. We created a detailed table with several criteria to ensure that tasks were assigned efficiently, tracked appropriately, and met deadlines. 

\subsection{Task Assignment Criteria}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Task}:

\begin{figure}[H]
   
    \begin{tabular}{m{0.2\textwidth} m{0.75\textwidth}}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/innovation project pic/TASKS/TASKS.png} & 
        \textit This column in the Google Sheet lists the name or description of each task that needs to be completed throughout the project. Tasks were broken down into smaller, manageable items to ensure clear focus and allocation of work.
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}
 
    \item \textbf{Responsability}:
\begin{figure}[H]
 
    \begin{tabular}{m{0.2\textwidth} m{0.75\textwidth}}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/innovation project pic/TASKS/responsible.png} & 
        \textit The person responsible for each task was clearly marked in the sheet. This allowed us to ensure accountability and made it easy to track who was working on what.
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

\newpage

    \item \textbf{Importance}:
\begin{figure}[H]
    
    \begin{tabular}{m{0.2\textwidth} m{0.75\textwidth}}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/innovation project pic/TASKS/importance.png} & 
        \textit In this column, we identified whether each task was "Important" or "Less Important". Tasks marked as "Important" were prioritized and handled first. This helped to focus on tasks critical for the projectâ€™s progress.
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

    \item \textbf{Online or at Mindcraft}:
\begin{figure}[H]
   
    \begin{tabular}{m{0.2\textwidth} m{0.75\textwidth}}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/innovation project pic/TASKS/task online or sur site.png} & 
        \textit This column indicated whether the task would be completed online or in the club (Mindcraft). For instance, some tasks required in-person collaboration or materials, while others could be done remotely.
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\newpage

    \item \textbf{Status}:
\begin{figure}[H]
   
    \begin{tabular}{m{0.2\textwidth} m{0.75\textwidth}}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/innovation project pic/TASKS/status.png} & 
        \textit The status category helps track the progress of each task. It includes labels like "Not Started," "In Progress," and "Done." This makes it easy to see which tasks are completed, which ones are ongoing, and which are yet to begin. Updating the status regularly ensures clarity and keeps everyone aligned
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

    \item \textbf{Deadline}:
\begin{figure}[H]
   
    \begin{tabular}{m{0.2\textwidth} m{0.8\textwidth}}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/innovation project pic/TASKS/deadline.png} & 
        \textit The deadline category organizes tasks by their due dates, helping prioritize work efficiently. Tasks with closer deadlines are tackled first, ensuring timely completion and reducing last-minute pressure. This system helps manage time effectively and keeps projects on schedule.

\begin{center}
    \huge \textbf{\textcolor{orange}{DESIGN OF HYDROBOT}} \\[0.5cm]
\end{center}
\section{\textbf{Design of HydroBot}}
\subsubsection{{Design Process in OnShape}}
To bring HydroBot to life, we started by designing the robotâ€™s components in **OnShape**, a cloud-based 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software. This tool allowed our team to collaborate in real-time, ensuring efficiency and precision in our designs.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/innovation project pic/DESIGN/onshape.png}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{{3D Printing with Creality}}

After finalizing the designs in OnShape, we moved on to the physical creation of HydroBotâ€™s components using **Creality 3D Printers**. 3D printing was chosen due to its precision, cost-effectiveness, and the flexibility it offers in prototyping. Hereâ€™s how we used the technology:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Printer Model}: We used the **Creality Ender 3** printer, known for its high accuracy and reliable performance.
    \item \textbf{Material Choice}: We used **PLA (Polylactic Acid)**, an eco-friendly filament, ensuring that the robotâ€™s components are both durable and sustainable.
    \item \textbf{Layer by layer Printing}: The robot parts were printed layer by layer, allowing us to maintain high resolution and minimize waste during production.
